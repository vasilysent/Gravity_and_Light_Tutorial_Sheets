# Tutorial Sheets for The WE-Heraeus International Winter School on Gravity and Light
That is a brilliant self-contained course on General Relativity and its mathematical foundations available on YouTube. It is mainly taught by also brilliant Dr. Frederic Schuller.

The WE-Heraeus International Winter School on Gravity and Light website (www.gravity-and-light.org) isn't available anymore. 
There were tutorial pdf sheets as well as video recordings. In this repository you can find all the tutorial sheets downloaded from the school website in the past.

Tutorial #9 doesn't exist.
